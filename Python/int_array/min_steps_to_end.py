# given an array of steps [2,3,1,1,2,4,2,0,1,1],
# each integar "i" means that you can jump from 1 step to i steps.
# write a function to find out the min steps to reach to the end from the
# start, here end means the last position of array
#           [2,  3,  1,  1,  2,  4,  2,  0,  1,  1]
# DP - each idx holds min steps arrived here
# min_steps [0,  1   1   2   2   3   3   4   4   4]
