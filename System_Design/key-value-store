Design a distributed key-value store for the Cloud.

Design a distributed key-value store system that efficiently manages a
large volume of data across multiple nodes while ensuring high availability,
fault tolerance, and low-latency access for read and write operations.
The system should be capable of provide strong consistency guarantees,
and allow for horizontal scalability to accommodate dynamic workloads and
data growth.


Functional requirements

- User shoule be able to perform CRUD operations on Key:value
- Should support a large volume of data
- resilient, low-lat
- Either HA or consistent]
